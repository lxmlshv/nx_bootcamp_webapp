The Dog Headed Tree is a meta-existent stoner music band. This band never becomes punk underground, but it does not alienate from the underground either. It helps all the inhabitants of this area to exist, who are string quartets by nature. Stoner music is a tool. But a tool isn't for everyone. It should be noted that a stoner is something like a tuning fork, with the help of which a certain group creates this or that resonance region. Resonant areas are areas that have a lot of music. It is given over the entire frequency spectrum. It's like ether.
